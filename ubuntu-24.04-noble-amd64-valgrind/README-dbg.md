# Debug image

Sometimes we'll get an error that's most easily reproduced in the
valgrind docker image. [citation needed]

The `build-dbg` and `dbg` shell provide some symbols and debugging
tools to fix that. Emacs is provided, as are some of the source packages.

You may need to set source directories with the `set substitute-path`
command.

e.g.:
